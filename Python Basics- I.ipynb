    "\n",
    "- Python is a `widely-used programming language` (popular) that is designed in such a way that it is  easy to read and write. \n",
    "- It is called `\"high-level\"` because human readable unlike other languages. \n",
    "  It allows programmers to write code that is closer to human language and further from machine language, \n",
    "  making it simpler to understand and work with.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### <font color=\"Blue\" size=+2 ><div style=\"text-align: justify\">Why Python is Considered High-Level: </font></div>\n",
    "- **Abstracts Complexity:**   Python handles many of the complexities, such as memory management and data type conversions, so the programmer doesn't have to.\n",
    "- **Easy Syntax:**  The syntax of Python is straightforward and intuitive, resembling plain English, which makes it easier for developers to write and read code.\n",
    "- **Built-in Functions and Libraries:**   Python comes with a rich set of built-in functions and libraries that allow developers to perform a wide range of tasks without needing to write additional code from scratch.\n",
    "- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**   Python code can run on various operating systems with minimal or no modification, making it versatile and convenient for developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  <font color=\"Blue\" size=+2 ><div style=\"text-align: justify\">How does the Python Language work? </font> </div>\n",
    "- Python code is first compiled to bytecode\n",
    "- which is then interpreted and executed by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM).\n",
    "\n",
    " >> - **Source code** is converted into **bytecode**, a lower-level, platform-independent representation of the code. \n",
    " >> - Bytecode files have a **`.pyc`** extension and are stored in a **`__pycache__`** directory.\n",
    " >> - The **Python Virtual Machine (PVM)** executes the bytecode. The PVM is an interpreter that reads the bytecode and performs the corresponding operations on the system's hardware.\n",
    " \n",

    "### <font color=\"Blue\" size=+2 ><div style=\"text-align: justify\">Key Features of Python </font> </div>\n",
    "**a. High-Level Language :**\n",
    "Python abstracts many of the complex details of the computer, such as memory management, making it easier to write and understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b. Interpreted Language :**\n",
    "Python is interpreted, meaning it executes the code line by line. This makes debugging easier but can be slower compared to compiled languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**c. Dynamically Typed :**\n",
    "Variable types are determined at runtime, which allows for more flexibility in coding but can lead to runtime errors if not managed carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "**d. Garbage Collection :**\n",
    "Python automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation through a garbage collector, which frees up memory that is no longer in use.\n",
    "\n",
    "**e. Extensive Standard Library :**\n",
    "Python comes with a large standard library that provides modules and functions for many common tasks, such as file I/O, system calls, and networking.\n",

This means you don't need to explicitly declare the type of a variable when you create it. Instead, Python infers the type based on the value assigned to the variable."

    "\n",
    "The primary purpose of computers is to process data into useful information, for that to happen, the data needs to be stored in its memory. This is achieved using a programming language's variables and data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data types in Python are particular kinds of data items, as defined by the value they can take. Variables, on the other hand, are like labeled containers that store this data. They enable you to manage and modify information using specific identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data types are generally classified into two types:\n",
    ">> - **Primitive (Fundamental) Data**\n",
    ">> - **Non-Primitive (Composite) Data** \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Primitive (Fundamental) Data Types in Python:**\n",
    "Primitive data types represent simple values. These data types are the most basic and essential units used to store and manipulate information in a program. They translate directly into low-level machine code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Primitive data types include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **String (str):** Represents sequences of characters. Should be enclosed in quotes. Example: \"Hello, Python!\"\n",
    "- **Integer (int):** Represents whole numbers without decimals. Example: 42\n",
    "- **Float (float):** Represents numbers with decimals. Example: 3.14\n",
    "- **Boolean (bool):** Represents either True or False.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Non-Primitive (Composite) Data Types in Python :**\n",
    "Non-primitive data types are structures that can hold multiple values and are composed of other data types, including both primitive and other composite types. Unlike primitive data types, non-primitive types allow for more complex and structured representations of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-primitive data types include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **List (list):** Represents an ordered and mutable collection of values. Example: fruits = [\"apple\",\"banana\", \"apple\",\"orange\"]\n",
    "- **Tuple (tuple):** Represents an ordered and immutable collection of values. Example: coordinates = (3, 7)\n",
    "- **Set (set) :** Respresents unordered collection of unique items.  Example : fruits = {\"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\"}\n",
    "- **Dictionary (dict):** Represents an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Example: person = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 25, \"is_student\": True}\n",
    "\n",
    "Characteristics of Non-Primitive Data Types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mutability: Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be modified after creation. Tuples, on the other hand, are immutable â€“ their elements cannot be changed. Dictionaries are mutable â€“ you can add, modify, or remove key-value pairs.\n",
    "- Collection of Values: Non-primitive data types allow the grouping of multiple values into a single structure, enabling the creation of more sophisticated data representations.\n",
    "- Ordered (Lists and Tuples): Lists and tuples maintain the order of elements, allowing for predictable indexing.\n",
    "- Key-Value Mapping (Dictionary): Dictionaries map keys to values, providing a way to organize and retrieve data based on specific identifiers.\n"
